    <ol>
      <li>
        Put the onion, carrots, garlic bay leaf, butter and half the olive oil
        into a large pan. Cook over a low–medium heat for about 10 minutes until
        the vegetables are tender but not coloured.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the squash and potato, mix to combine and cook for a further 2–3
        minutes. Pour in the stock, season well and bring to the boil. Reduce
        the heat to a gentle simmer, half cover the pan with a lid and continue
        to cook for about 40 minutes until the squash is really tender when
        tested with the point of a knife.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pick out the bay leaf and blend the soup until smooth using a stick
        blender.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the cream and a little more stock if the soup is on the thick side,
        taste for seasoning, adding more salt and pepper as required.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat the remaining oil in a frying pan over a medium heat and
        add the pumpkin seeds and fry quickly until the seeds start to pop.
        Remove from the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ladle the soup into bowls and serve with a swirl of cream and the
        toasted pumpkin seeds.
